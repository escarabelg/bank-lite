### Notes
If you encounter a Prisma compilation error after making changes, especially if you haven't had a chance to test on Windows, check the updated Prisma documentation to verify the correct target for Windows. It might need to be set to native if it isn't already.
```
binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-musl-openssl-3.0.x"]
